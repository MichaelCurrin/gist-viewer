# Set up and run

## Installation

Clone the repo.

You don't need Node to use a web app. Just a static server, as below.


## Serve

Start a dev server in the repo root. See [Start a dev server](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/1a6116a4e0918c8468dc7e1a701a5f95) guide for ideas.

Open the browser on your localhost address.
